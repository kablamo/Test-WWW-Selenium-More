Test::WWW::Selenium::More::Manual - Testing with Selenium


=head1 INTRODUCTION

Test-WWW-Selenium is a test library that enables you to write user interface
tests for your web application.  You can fill out forms, click buttons and
links, and generally control any supported browser from your Perl tests.  

It works by sending commands to a Selenium server via HTTP GET/POST requests.
The Selenium server spawns a browser and controls it using using JavaScript.

You can also watch your tests interacting with your web application in the
browser.
