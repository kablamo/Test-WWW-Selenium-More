Test::WWW::Selenium::More::Manual::RunningTests

=head1 RUNNING SELENIUM TESTS

This section describes setting up and running Selenium Perl tests on the command
line.  There are 3 steps to making this work:

=over 4

=item 1. Start your web application

=item 2. Start the Selenium server

=item 3. Run your Perl tests

=back

Each of these components may or may not run on the same computer depending on
how you want to set it up.  The only tricky part is configuring the right
servers and ports so all 3 components talk to each other.  This is done either
with the options you pass to Test::WWW::Selenium::More->new() (see L<WWW::Selenium>)
or with the environment variables described in L<Test::WWW::Selenium::More>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

These examples assume the web application you want to test is running on
localhost, port 5000.  

Basic setup

    # Start the Selenium server
    java -jar selenium-server.jar -port 4444 -trustAllSSLCertificates -browserSessionReuse

    # Run your tests against your web app running on localhost, port 80
    prove -lrv t/test.t


Headless server setup

    # Start Xvfb so you can run a web browser without X Windows
    Xvfb :99

    # Start the Selenium server
    DISPLAY=:99 java -jar selenium-server.jar -port 4444 -trustAllSSLCertificates -browserSessionReuse

    # Run your tests 
    prove -lrv t/test.t


Run Selenium tests against a remote website

    SELENIUM_BROWSER_URL=http://example.com prove -lrv t/test.t


Run tests against a remote Selenium server

    # Start the Selenium server on the remote host (lets say 99.99.99.99).  
    # Then run your tests locally like this:
    SELENIUM_HOST=99.99.99.99 prove -lrv t/test.t


Running tests slowly

    # Tests fly by too fast sometimes when you are watching them in the
    # browser.  This slows things down.  It basically calls sleep after every
    # call to the Selenium server
    SELENIUM_SLEEP=1 prove -lrv t/test.t
